# 8ch-parallel-pin-delayer-2023
 8channel pin HIGH signal delayer
for arduino style mcu, could be adapted

here i used a mini pro 5V 16MHz setup with 8 IN/OUT

// 8 channel pin signal(HIGH) delay(er)

// - by VigilanteSystems - opensource - 23.03.2023

// its to delay signals from 8 channel parallel port signals to relays to avoid toggling relays at system reboot/bootup etc ...

... bootup toggle...
